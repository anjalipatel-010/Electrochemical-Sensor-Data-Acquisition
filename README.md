# Electrochemical-Sensor-Data-Acquisition
An Arduino-based data acquisition system for electrochemical three-electrode sensors. It uses a potentiostat circuit and op-amps for signal amplification, logs real-time data via Arduino ADC, and supports analysis in MATLAB, Python, or Excel. Ideal for biosensing, monitoring, and chemical analysis.
# Electrochemical-Sensor-Data-Acquisition

An Arduino-based data acquisition system designed for interfacing with a three-electrode electrochemical sensor. The system collects analog sensor signals, digitizes the data, and transmits it to a PC for real-time monitoring or further analysis.

## üîå Circuit Overview

- The three-electrode sensor outputs are conditioned using an op-amp circuit.
- The conditioned analog signal is fed into the Arduino‚Äôs ADC input (typically `A0`).
- Arduino converts this signal to digital form and sends the data via serial to a computer.
- The collected data can be logged or plotted in real-time using Serial Plotter or other tools.

## üíª Firmware

The Arduino sketch reads analog values from the sensor and transmits them via serial:

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(100);  // Adjust sampling rate as needed
}
