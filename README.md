# Electrochemical-Sensor-Data-Acquisition
An Arduino-based data acquisition system for electrochemical three-electrode sensors. It uses a potentiostat circuit and op-amps for signal amplification, logs real-time data via Arduino ADC, and supports analysis in MATLAB, Python, or Excel. Ideal for biosensing, monitoring, and chemical analysis.
